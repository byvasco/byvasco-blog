            <p class="article-excerpt body-serif">I’ve finally launched the blog here on my website! I wanted to do this for some time, because I want to start writing more and I want to build like an online home for myself, to host all my projects, my ideas, my thoughts, and even though I also share my words on Medium, it’s a good idea to have my own blog as well, so I can get full control.

            <p class="article-excerpt body-serif">Onto the second part of this series where I’m creating a website for my friend Ana Guerra and documenting the process of doing so! To get some context of what’s going on, here’s the 1st part.

            <h2 class="article-title title-2">Building Ana's Website, Pt 1</h2>
            <p class="article-excerpt body-serif">Starting from the beginning. My friend Ana Guerra started thinking about creating a newsletter and we talked about creating some kind of landing page for that. However, there are a few more things she’s into — she also writes and has a podcast. So we thought we should take it a step further and just create a full website to serve as her personal home on the internet to house every project she has going on, and for future stuff as well!

            <p class="article-excerpt body-serif">So my car just broke something while I was driving — I’m literally writing this while on the side of a highway waiting for the tow truck to arrive, and I thought it would be a perfect time to write this article.

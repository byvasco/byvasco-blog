          <p>Onto the second part of this series where I‚Äôm creating a website for my friend Ana Guerra and documenting the process of doing so! To get some context of what‚Äôs going on, here‚Äôs the 1st part.</p>

<p>She is also doing it on her podcast, here‚Äôs the first episode, the second one is coming soon.</p>

<h3 id="a-quick-recap-from-the-last-article">A quick recap from the last article:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We know what kind of website this is and what the goal is‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto serve as a digital home for all the content and projects Ana has.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And we also know all the pages needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decided on what direction to follow regarding look and feel for this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Got the color palette and the main typeface.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And finally, I created the folder structure on my computer for this project.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After this, I have kind of a clear idea of how the final product could look like.</p>

<h3 id="starting-out">Starting out</h3>
<p>First, a confession of a bad habit I have.</p>

<p>Usually, in the starting phase of a project, I go straight to Google or Dribbble to grab some inspiration. I think this is a bad habit because I‚Äôm not exercising my mind to come up with an original solution for the given problem.</p>

<p>But there‚Äôs also another side of the coin. I don‚Äôt believe in pure, 100% originality. Because I need some kind of influence.</p>

<p>What I do believe is that I‚Äôm in a constant ‚Äúsponge mode‚Äù. Constantly observing the world around me, the products and interfaces I interact with, the movies I watch and the books that I read. As a result, I‚Äôm building like a mental library of ideas that I can use in my work.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc">Everything is a Remix</a> by Kirby Ferguson is a great video that relates to this line of thought.</p>

<p>So, this time, I grabbed a pen and just sketched the ideas that were floating around in my head. Nothing fancy or stunning.</p>

<h3 id="to-the-screen">To the screen</h3>
<p>When I feel that I dumped all my ideas onto paper, I move to the computer, where I start to play around with typography and colors.</p>

  </figure>

<p>However, my process is kind of organic. What I mean by this, is that I don‚Äôt follow a strict path or series of steps. I like to go back and forth between my notepad and my computer.</p>

<p>It was at this time that I realized we should find a typeface for body copy.</p>

<p><!--

    </a>
  </figure>

<p>Ana has been using <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway">Raleway</a> across all her assets, and I ended up finding <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter UI</a>, a somewhat neutral looking typeface that was designed to be easily legible on computer screens. I love how they look when combined!</p>

<h3 id="creating-the-first-home-concept">Creating the first Home concept</h3>
<p>After exploring a bit, I started to make a basic mockup for the Home page.</p>

<p>One thing that went through my mind was that, besides the blog posts, there‚Äôs not much text to put on the website. And I wanted to find a way to somehow use typography to keep things interesting but at the same time maintaining the clean and simple vibe to it.</p>

<p>So I played around a bit and ended up creating this concept for the Home.</p>

  </figure>

<p>There‚Äôs no pictures or colors, I just wanted to figure out how I could layout the different sections to use the content we have using the chosen typefaces.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a quick overview of its different parts, starting with the top section.</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption class="text-smaller caption">The top section is as simple as it gets</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>The header will have the same picture of Ana uses on all social media channels on the left, and a basic navigation menu on the right, with links to the other pages.</p>

<p>I think the ‚ÄúHello you‚Äù and the ‚ÄúThis is Ana Guerra‚Äù blocks help to create some movement, instead of just having a straight, centered column of text. And it‚Äôs also the same way she introduces herself on the podcast, so we can keep that consistent here on the website!</p>

  </figure>

<p>Now, on those 3 sections (Podcast, Blog and Newsletter), the idea is that each title works as a divider between them, and while we‚Äôre scrolling through the page it slowly slides to the left.</p>

<p>I think <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway">Raleway</a> looks great on larger sizes, especially on heavier weights, and it works wonders for this concept.</p>

<p>This title part actually started with a dash in between the words. But then I had the idea of replacing that for a piece of text that communicates the posting frequency.</p>

<p>I like it!</p>

<p>The Newsletter section is a bit different than the other two.</p>

  </figure>

<p><a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/invite/H7NiyFlukld7scG6OuDnPp">The newsletter</a> is delivered through Whatsapp.</p>

<p>So the idea here is to have like a mobile device on the right side, displaying the Whatsapp‚Äôs chat UI, on the left a button to join and another to the dedicated Newsletter page (which will also serve as a landing page) in order to get more information.</p>

<p>To finish things up, there‚Äôs the footer.</p>

  </figure>

<p>It basically consists of a series of icons that link to all the different platforms where Ana is.</p>

<h3 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h3>
<p>Well, in this particular case I almost did no research to check out what‚Äôs currently out there, mainly because I got to that concept I showed you above pretty quickly after exploring for a few hours.</p>

<p>I already had a list of 4 or 5 websites that served as a reference, that we collected on the first meeting we had. Other than that I only navigated a bit through my <a href="https://www.pinterest.pt/vascogmm/typography/">Typography Board on Pinterest</a> and <a href="http://typeonly.tumblr.com/">Typeonly</a> to get the creative juices flowing.</p>

<h3 id="communication-and-getting-feedback">Communication and getting feedback</h3>
<p>Me and Ana have been using Whatsapp to talk and to get her opinions and feedback regarding the work, I‚Äôve been using <a href="https://marvelapp.com/">Marvel</a> to do that job.</p>

<h3 id="next-things-to-do">Next things to do</h3>
<p>The next step is to create the mockups for all the remaining pages.</p>

<p>Once I get all done, I‚Äôll bring some colors in and take care of things in a more detailed level.</p>

<p>See you soon in part 3! üëãüèº</p>

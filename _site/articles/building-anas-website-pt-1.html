        <p>Starting from the beginning. My friend Ana Guerra started thinking about creating a newsletter and we talked about creating some kind of landing page for that. However, there are a few more things she’s into — she also writes and has a podcast. So we thought we should take it a step further and just create a full website to serve as her personal home on the internet to house every project she has going on, and for future stuff as well!</p>

<p>This is the beginning of a series where me and Ana will document the full process of building her website. I’ll write here on Medium and on my website, and she’s doing it on her podcast. <a href="https://anchor.fm/anarlguerra/episodes/Vasco-is-building-my-website-EP-1-e2hfas/a-a698fv">Here’s the first episode</a>!</p>

<p>After we landed on this conclusion, we met for a coffee after work to chat a bit about what this website should and shouldn’t do, and what content should be in there. Basically, we defined the general concept/idea.</p>

<h3 id="what-kind-of-website-will-this-be">What kind of website will this be?</h3>
<p>I would call this a personal website. On the home page there’s gonna be a short introduction of who Ana is and what she does, and then <strong>3 different sections</strong> to showcase the different types of content she creates (podcast, the blog, and the newsletter), where the podcast and the blog sections will have the most recent episodes/posts.</p>

<p>Besides the home page, there will be a few other pages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a page specifically for the podcast with all the episodes
the blog, with all the blog posts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a page for the newsletter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a contact page</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and in the future we might build a gear page, to showcase all the different equipment she uses on a daily basis</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="colors-typography-and-overall-feel">Colors, typography, and overall feel</h3>
<p>Ana has already defined the color palette for her brand, and she’s also been using Raleway as the main typeface, so that’s awesome. I might introduce another one a bit more neutral for body copy, but I still need to explore a bit on that.</p>

<p>I’m happy that the colors are pretty bright and vivid, because that reenforces who she is: a person full of energy and with lots of will to do stuff!</p>

<p>Overall, the goal is to make this look simple, modern, young and to the point.</p>

<h3 id="first-steps">First steps</h3>
<p>The first thing I did was to create the folder structure on my computer. I have 4 different folders here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Docs</strong>: where I’ll save all kinds of documents Ana sends me</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Assets</strong>: for images, icons, etc</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Design</strong>: this will be where all the Sketch files will live</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Shared</strong>: the folder where I’ll put everything I want to share with Ana, like final designs, assets for her to use, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This was highly inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU_O9BOWyVE&amp;ab_channel=JesseShowalter">Jesse Showalter’s method</a>. I recommend you to check out his channel for awesome design related content!</p>

<p>What I also like to do is to create a couple of artboards in Sketch to build the color palette and even though in this case it’s nothing complex, I also like to create the sitemap.</p>

<p>Lastly, I make sure I get all the written content that should be displayed on the website so that I can <strong>design around the content and not the other way around</strong> — after all, the content is the most important thing!</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>
<p>Ok so next I’ll be exploring a bit on pen and paper just to get my ideas going on how the layout could be.</p>

<p>Another thing is to look for other people’s personal websites just to get a sense of what’s out there, and after that, it’s time to start designing!</p>

<p>I’ll leave this for the next post, which shouldn’t take too long to come out.</p>

<p>See you in part 2! 👋🏼</p>

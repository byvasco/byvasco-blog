I think the title says it all - let’s try this for the 982th time: Hello world! I have been quite busy with not only work, but also with being constantly overthinking everything and every detail and every decision.

I can not tell you how many times I have designed this website, even though it’s as basic as it can possibly be. And how many times I start something and then I don’t finish it because I either jump to something else, or I just lose the interest and drop it off.
